<h1> Photography </h1>
<p> Below are photos I've taken out in nature. These are probably some of my favorite things to take photos of. Everythign is just so beautifulâ€“whether that be sunset/sunrise images, plants, trees, anything. I like to just go out by myself and take these photos, and it's such a relaxing time for me and it really is just so fun to do. These are some of my favorite photos that I have taken. </p>

<p> This is a photo I took in the Outer Banks, NC at sunrise the day I was leaving to go back home. I typically don't take photos of sunrises (usually because I'm rarely up that early), but I'm glad I was up for this one because it was beautiful. </p>
