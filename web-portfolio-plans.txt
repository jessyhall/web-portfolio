my plan for this site is to display my photography work from over the past several years. my plan is to have 2 tabs for photography—one for photos of nature and one for photos of anything else, whether that be man made objects, people, skylines, etc. i also will have an about tab where i give a brief bio of myself and include an email link so people could contact me. I don’t have a super concrete plan for the rest yet, but over the next couple weeks i will have a lot more time to work on the formatting/overall layout of the site.
