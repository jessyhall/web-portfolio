<h2> Nature Photography </h2>
  <p> Below are photos I've taken out in nature. These are probably some of my favorite things to take photos of. Everything is just so beautiful--whether that be sunset/sunrise images, plants, trees, anything. I like to just go out by myself and take these photos, and it's such a relaxing time for me and it really is just so fun to do. These are some of my favorite photos that I have taken. </p>
  <img src="images/sunrise.png">
    <p> This is a photo I took in the Outer Banks, NC at sunrise the day I was leaving to go back home. I typically don't take photos of sunrises (usually because I'm rarely up that early), but I'm glad I was up for this one because it was beautiful. </p>

  <img src="images/rollercoaster.png">
    <p> This is a photo I took of the Steel Curtain rollercoaster at Kennywood Park in West Mifflin, PA. I like this photo a lot because of the way the sun is backlighting the rollercoaster, making there be a shadowy effect, but you can still see the colors of the rollercoaster as opposed to it being a complete sillhouete. </p>
