my plan for this site is to display my photography work from over the past several years, as well as include a tab for works completed in this class. I'll have two types of photography--nature and other, to separate the separate types of photography i like to do, and i'll include a blurb about each photograph. What i need to figure out before turning in the final version is figure out how to make these into two columns. The outline from the book has 3 columns so i'll need to figure out how to make it into two instead. In the classwork tab i'll include my soundscape narrative and my visual argument and some little blurbs about each one. i also have an about column on the homepage with a photo of myself and a little blurb about myself.
