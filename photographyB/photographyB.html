<img src="images/rollercoaster.png">
<p> This is a photo I took of the Steel Curtain rollercoaster at Kennywood Park in West Mifflin, PA. I like this photo a lot because of the way the sun is backlighting the rollercoaster, making there be a shadowy effect, but you can still see the colors of the rollercoaster as opposed to it being a complete sillhouete. </p>
